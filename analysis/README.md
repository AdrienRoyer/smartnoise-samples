# Sample Analysis Notebooks

### Python Notebooks 
The following notebooks use the WhiteNoise Core Rust library and validator through Python bindings.

* [Notebook with Tutorial](https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/whitenoise-samples/analysis/data_analysis_tutorial.ipynb): 
* [Notebook on utility](https://github.com/opendifferentialprivacy/whitenoise-samples/analysis/utility_laplace_mean.ipynb): Demonstrate through simulation how the noise of the final answer from a differentially private query on a dataset mean varies by the size of the dataset and the choice of privacy-loss (epsilon) parameter.
